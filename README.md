# CS6140 Project 3

## Team members

- Haotian Shen
- Qiaozhi Liu

## Operating System

- Apple M1 pro chip, this will make the `tensorflow` library a bit different. If you are using M1 chip, install `miniconda`
  and `tensorflow-macos` and `tensorflow-metal` instead of the plain tensorflow. Otherwise, you will not be able to run the
  neural network model on your M1 mac. If you prefer not to install, simply comment out these two libraries from
  the `requirements.txt` and also comment out the train_neural_network function and code in the file.
- Pycharm and macOS
- To install all libraries used by this file, create a virtual environment at the project folder or simply open it in
  PyCharm. PyCharm can automatically set it for you. Then in the terminal, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- If you are not using a mac, install the proper `tensorflow` library is required. It is not included in
  the `requirements.txt`.
